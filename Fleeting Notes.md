Callback queue

Event Loop

the call stack: one thread, one call stack, one thing at a time.
The Call stack is a datastructure that keeps track of the progress of the program(where the program is and what's currently being run). Stepping into a functino we push it to the stack and returning from function we take it off the stack. 

Does the javascript engine run the application. The source of it all? HQ almost? What is the analogy.


For understanding:
- making questions for you to test your understanding
	- Idea behind this is teaching it will allow you to express the connections and flow smoothly and then from there you can also see holes in your understanding
- Making connections with other ideas... such as previous, similar,
- Understanding how this idea comes from something else or where it comes from
- Thinking about what it might relate to next, or how it can be built upon(what something enables)
- Making analogies...

The solution to blocking? asynchronous callbacks

What is asynch and sync? What do async functions do?
