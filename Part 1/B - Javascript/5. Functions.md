Defining arrow function syntax
```js
const sum = (p1, p2) => {
  console.log(p1)
  console.log(p2)
  return p1 + p2
}
```

autonomyous function takes in argus p1 p2. My confusions is that it seems like it's beter to just define a function name instead. But In a way it's almost like the same since the way you use it would be as followed.

```js
const result = sum(1, 5)
console.log(result)
```

although a cons var is storing the function definition are you unable to define a function like so

```

sum(p1,p2 ){
	code...
}
```
