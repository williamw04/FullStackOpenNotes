Defining arrow function syntax
```js
const sum = (p1, p2) => {
  console.log(p1)
  console.log(p2)
  return p1 + p2
}
```

If there is just a single parameter, we can exclude the parentheses from the definition:

```js
const square = p => {
  console.log(p)
  return p * p
}
```

If the function only contains a single expression then the braces are not needed. In this case, the function only returns the result of its only expression. Now, if we remove console printing, we can further shorten the function definition:

```js
const square = p => p * p
```

This form is particularly handy when manipulating arrays - e.g. when using the map method:

```js
const t = [1, 2, 3]
const tSquared = t.map(p => p * p)
// tSquared is now [1, 4, 9]
```

autonomous function takes in argus p1 p2. My confusions is that it seems like it's beter to just define a function name instead. But In a way it's almost like the same since the way you use it would be as followed.

```js
const result = sum(1, 5)
console.log(result)
```

although a cons var is storing the function definition are you unable to define a function like so

```

sum(p1,p2 ){
	code...
}
```
